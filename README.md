# SnowCone-ProgrammingLanguage
One of my biggest thought experiments. Building a new programming language

The purpose of this language is to hopefully aid in the Front-end world. A programming language to both help people newer
to programming learn, and to serve as a teaching language to get those from incredibly poor backgrounds interested in programming. 
It'll be similar to HTML, and in fact, most likely use many aspects of Javascript, HTML, and CSS to help bring a one package solution to programming and hopefully be used as a teaching langauge. 

One of the biggest issues in education right now, is for a majority of schools, they cannot afford a Computer Science class. 
anyone who is knowledgeable about coding isn't going to go into teaching, so most well developed classes rely on volunteer labor from well experienced programmers. SnowCone I hope will change that, allowing even someone with little to no programming experience to learn programming, and simply get a taste of what programming is like. A simple snack, a SnowCone, if you will. Sweet, low calorie, and a ton of fun. 

If you're reading this, and have any experience with creating a programming language and would like to help me, please reach out to me, I would love any and all help! I'm mostly relying on my own knowledge and online guides to start this, as I have no formal classes on how to make a programming language under my belt. 

Thanks for reading this! And who knows, I really hope that in the future, programming can become more accessible to lower income individuals, and not just a field meant for the affluent who can afford the education.
